        <div class="Aboutme">
            <p class="inline-text">Hello, I am Irene Lee. <br> <br> I am a freelance UX/UI designer, with a solid
                foundation
                in
                Architecture, Interior, and
                Graphic Design, and with certification in UX/UI design from UC Berkeley Extension Program. My
                experience
                includes proficiency in branding, visual design, and problem-solving. I am passionate about expanding my
                skill
                set and delving into the User Experience Design. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
                text
                ever
                since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
                book. It
                has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
                essentially
                unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem.

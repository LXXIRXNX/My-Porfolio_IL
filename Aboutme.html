    <h1 class="inline-About Me">About Me</h1>
    <p class="inline-text">Hello, I am Irene Lee. <br> <br> I am a freelance UX/UI designer, with a solid foundation in
        Architecture, Interior, and
        Graphic Design, and with certification in UX/UI design from UC Berkeley Extension Program. <br> My experience
        includes proficiency in branding, visual design, and problem-solving. I am passionate about expanding my skill
        set and delving into the User Experience Design. <br> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
        ever
        since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
        <br> It
        has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
        unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets <br>
        containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem.
